# MVP
** HTML/SCSS
Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
Minimum 3 icons on desktop
The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
Apps look consistent
Menu contains a flex with content inside it
Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form

** JavaScript
Put your js code into separate files
Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
Give your functions and variables good names
Use the arrow syntax to declare functions
